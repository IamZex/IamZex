- 👋 Hi, I’m @IamZex
- 👀 I’m interested in chess and I'd like to make a site with a working chessboard and ability for multiple boards to be seen at once so people can follow a tournament.

Hello there I'm going to add some of my chess games to this instead of a Recipe file. I'm not all that interested in making a recipe site so this will be something new.

If you're looking at this I hope you are living in a world made just a bit better than the day before. 

Right now I'm hoping that I can create a site that will show off what I've learned in the Odin project perhaps to work at a site at chess.com or lichess or similar. 

I'm hoping that after this is done it looks like a polished site and not some frankensteins monster.
